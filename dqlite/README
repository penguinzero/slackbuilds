Dqlite ("distributed SQLite") extends SQLite across a cluster of machines,
with automatic failover and high-availability to keep your application running.
It uses C-Raft, an optimised Raft implementation in C, to gain high-performance
transactional consensus and fault tolerance while preserving SQliteâ€™s outstanding
efficiency and tiny footprint.
